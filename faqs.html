          When faced with changing requirements or scope in a project, I believe
          in maintaining flexibility and adaptability. I understand that
          evolving needs are a natural part of the software development process.
          In such situations, I proactively communicate with stakeholders to
          understand the reasons behind the changes and the impact on the
          project timeline and deliverables. I then collaborate with the team to
          assess the feasibility of the adjustments and prioritize tasks
          accordingly. By maintaining open communication and embracing change, I
          ensure that the project remains on track and aligned with the evolving
          needs of the organization.

          Ensuring the quality and reliability of software deliverables is of
          utmost importance to me. I follow a comprehensive approach that
          includes various practices and techniques. Firstly, I engage in
          thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and
          end-to-end testing, to identify and address any issues or bugs. I also
          believe in conducting regular code reviews to promote best coding
          practices, maintain code consistency, and identify potential areas for
          improvement. Additionally, I actively stay updated with industry
          standards, emerging technologies, and best practices to incorporate
          the latest advancements into my work. By prioritizing quality
          assurance throughout the development lifecycle, I strive to deliver
          software that meets or exceeds the expectations of stakeholders.
